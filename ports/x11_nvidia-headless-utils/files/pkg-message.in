Running Xorg-nvidia-headless at startup is recommended especially on mobile
systems since leaving Nvidia GPU powered on with no Xorg may consume
significantly more power.

# sysrc nvidia_xorg_enable=YES
# service nvidia_xorg start

Install x11/nvidia-hybrid-graphics if graphical output of the Nvidia
accelerated application on the current X11 display is required.

Modify %%PREFIX%%/etc/X11/xorg-nvidia-headless-template.conf to change general
Xorg options, or run %%PREFIX%%/bin/nvidia-headless-xconfig, then edit
%%PREFIX%%/etc/X11/xorg-nvidia-headless.conf if post-xconfig modifications are
required.

Running %%PREFIX%%/bin/nvidia-headless-xconfig will allow Xorg-nvidia-headless
to run as non-superuser if Xorg has been installed setuid.
