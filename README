This repository contains all the needed pieces to use OpenGL on a headless
Nvidia GPU (such as in Optimus configuration) on Freebsd, without interfering
with functionality of primary GPU device (such as Intel).

Optionally, graphical output of application running on Nvidia can be forwarded
to primary display using VirtualGL.

The ports are designed for eventual integration into FreeBSD ports tree.



Testing / installation:

Assumes $CHECKOUT is where this project is checked out
Assumes https://svn.freebsd.org/ports/head is checked out to /usr/ports

Setup - as root:

  Prepare ports tree
        ( cd /usr/ports && \
          svn patch $CHECKOUT/ports/x11_nvidia-driver_Makefile.diff )
        cp -r $CHECKOUT/ports/x11_nvidia-headless-driver \
          /usr/ports/x11/nvidia-headless-driver
        cp -r $CHECKOUT/ports/x11_nvidia-headless-utils \
          /usr/ports/x11/nvidia-headless-utils

  Build ports
        make -C /usr/ports/x11/nvidia-headless-utils install

    Option: graphical output using VirtualGL
        make -C /usr/ports/x11/virtualgl install

  Configure headless Xorg
        kldload nvidia-modeset
        nvidia-headless-xconfig

Startup - as root:

        kldload nvidia-modeset
        Xorg-nvidia-headless

Running applications - as user:

  (headless)
        nvrun glxinfo -B

  (graphical output):
        nvrun-vgl glxgears
