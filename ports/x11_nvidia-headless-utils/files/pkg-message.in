Run %%PREFIX%%/bin/nvidia-headless-xconfig to set NVIDIA options.
This will also allow Xorg-nvidia-headless to run as non-superuser if Xorg has
been installed setuid.

Running Xorg-nvidia-headless at startup is recommended especially on mobile
systems since leaving Nvidia GPU powered on with no Xorg may consume
significantly more power.

Consider installing x11/nvidia-hybrid-graphics if graphical output of the
Nvidia accelerated application on the current X11 display is required.
